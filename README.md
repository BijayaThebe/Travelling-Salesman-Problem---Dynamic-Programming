# ðŸ§­ Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)

The **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)** is one of the most famous problems in computer science and operations research.  
It asks:

> Given `n` cities and the distances between each pair, find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting point.

## ðŸ”¹ Problem Types

1. **Decision Version (NP-Complete)**  
   - Question: *"Does there exist a tour with cost â‰¤ K?"*
   - Belongs to **NP-Complete** problems.

2. **Optimization Version (NP-Hard)**  
   - Question: *"What is the minimum-cost tour?"*
   - Classified as **NP-Hard**, meaning no known polynomial-time algorithm exists for solving it exactly.

## ðŸ”¹ Complexity Analysis

### 1. Brute Force
- Try all possible permutations of cities.
- Number of tours: `(n-1)! / 2`  
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n!)`  
- **Accuracy:** âœ… Exact (but impractical for large `n`).

---

### 2. Dynamic Programming (Heldâ€“Karp Algorithm)
- Uses bitmasking and DP to reduce redundant calculations.  
- **Time Complexity:** `O(nÂ² * 2^n)`  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n * 2^n)`  
- **Accuracy:** âœ… Exact (faster than brute force, but still exponential).

### 3. Approximation & Heuristics
Since exact algorithms are infeasible for large `n`, practical methods are used:

| Algorithm                  | Time Complexity | Accuracy |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|----------|
| Nearest Neighbor            | `O(nÂ²)`        | Approximate |
| Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) | `O(nÂ² log n)`  | Approximate |
| Christofides Algorithm      | `O(nÂ³)`        | â‰¤ 1.5 Ã— Optimal (metric TSP) |
| Metaheuristics (GA, ACO, SA)| Varies         | Good in practice |

    F -->|40| C
    F -->|16| D
    F -->|35| E



## ðŸ”¹ Growth of Complexity Example

| Cities (`n`) | Brute Force Permutations |
|--------------|---------------------------|
| 5            | 24                        |
| 10           | 181,440                   |
| 15           | 43,589,145,600            |
| 20           | ~ 6.08 Ã— 10^16            |

âš¡ Complexity grows explosively as `n` increases.

## ðŸ”¹ Summary

- **TSP is NP-Hard (optimization) and NP-Complete (decision).**
- No polynomial-time algorithm is known for solving TSP exactly.
- Approximation and heuristic methods are widely used in real-world applications (logistics, route planning, circuit design).

---

## ðŸš€ Applications

- Route planning (delivery, transportation, traveling)
- Circuit design (VLSI layout)
- Genome sequencing (bioinformatics)
- Network optimization
